# Snake Game Challenge
This is a responsive React.js snake game project.

The game is deployed to my GitHub Page: [https://jundesu.github.io/snake_game/](https://jundesu.github.io/snake_game/)

You can play it on a mobile or desktop browser.
- Mobile: control the snake by the virtual buttons.
- Desktop: both virtual buttons and real keyboard can control the snake. 

### Rules
1. Click the start button to play the game.
2. Eat an item to get one point.
3. Each item eaten makes the snake longer.
4. The movement speed will be increased when the score rises.
5. The game is over when the snake hits itself or the border. You can restart it by clicking the start button.
