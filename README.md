You can play it on a mobile or desktop browser.
- Mobile: control the snake by the virtual buttons.
- Desktop: both virtual buttons and real keyboard can control the snake. 

### Rules
1. Click the start button to play the game.
2. Eat an item to get one point.
3. Each item eaten makes the snake longer.
4. The movement speed will be increased when the score rises.
5. The game is over when the snake hits itself or the border. You will see the shaking snake CSS animation then click the start button to restart game.
